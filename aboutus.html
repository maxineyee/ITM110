  <br>We are excited to introduce Digital Espresso. If you crave great coffee, you’ll love knowing that we provide a real alternative to chains with handcrafted coffee and espresso drinks, a full tea bar, and real food options.</br>
  <br>Our local baristas know that great espresso takes more than pushing a button. We work hard to deliver great taste while also providing knowledgeable service, perfect if you just want to try something new.</br>
  <br>Our Cafe delivers way beyond the traditional coffee shop favorites (although we think our homemade pastries are pretty good). We have traditional breakfast choices, including eggs and pancakes, and plenty of healthy options (including gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan). Our lunch offerings include a wide variety of salads,  sandwiches and flatbreads.   And as for the late nighters… we know you’ll appreciate having a spot for your dessert fix as well as a spiked coffee.</br>
